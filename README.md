## FGR: A Unified Framework for Feature Selection via Feature Graph Reduction

This repository provides a python implementation of FGR as described in the paper ["A Unified Framework for Feature Selection via Feature Graph Reduction"](https://).

## Datasets
The datasets are accessible through the UCI machine learning repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) or scikit-feature selection repository (https://jundongl.github.io/scikit-feature/datasets.html).

## Environment Settings
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- pandas
- tqdm
- os

## Running the code
For supervised scenarios, you can directly run the following code
```sh
main_FGR_SFS.py
```
or run the following function for unsupervised scenarios
```sh
main_FGR_UFS.py
```
